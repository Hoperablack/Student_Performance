# Student Performance Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze student performance data to identify trends in academic progress, including periods of improvement and decline. By understanding these patterns, the school can implement strategies to enhance student performance. The analysis focuses on student scores, extracurricular activities, and other key factors.

## Business Questions Answered

This analysis addresses the following business-level questions:

1. **Correlations Between Tables**:
   - How are different tables of student data correlated?

2. **Changes in Student Scores**:
   - What are the mean and median changes in student scores over time?

3. **Improvement and Decline Counts**:
   - How many students showed improvement, and how many showed decline in their performance?

4. **Key Performance Statistics**:
   - What are the average, median, and standard deviation of student performance?

5. **Performance by Gender**:
   - What is the average score for male and female students?

6. **Impact of Extracurricular Activities on Performance**:
   - Do students with extracurricular activities have higher scores?

## Data Sources

The dataset used for this project includes student performance data, including individual scores, participation in extracurricular activities, and other related information. The data is used to analyze various factors affecting student performance.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

To prepare the data for analysis, the following steps were performed:

- **Merging Data**: Combined data from various sources or tables.
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Removed any rows with missing values or outliers.
  - Converted data types for relevant columns.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created new columns where needed, such as changes in student scores over time.
  - Calculated correlation between different features to understand relationships.

## Analysis and Visualization

The analysis uses **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Matplotlib** for visualizing the data. Key visualizations include:

- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Displaying the relationships between different features in the dataset.
- **Bar Graphs and Line Graphs**: Used to visualize improvements, declines, and performance statistics.
- **Box Plots**: To show the distribution of performance across different groups, including gender and extracurricular activity participation.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into:
- The overall trend of student performance, including improvements and declines.
- The impact of gender and extracurricular activities on student performance.
- Statistical measures like the average, median, and standard deviation of student scores.

These insights can help the school target areas for improvement and implement strategies to boost performance.
